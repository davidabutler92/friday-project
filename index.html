        <h1>Object of the game</h1>
          <p>Magic is a turn based game with many different styles of playing. You can play on teams or have an all out free-for-all. The object is to defeat your opponent. Eveyone starts with 20 life and 0 life means defeat. To do this you will be using creature cards and different kinds of spells.</p>

         <p>Land cards are a resource in magic. At the start of each turn you can play 1 land card. Depending on the mana cost (mana gained from land cards) you can summon different creatures and spells. Stronger creature and spells cards cost more mana and in turn will take more lands cards. To use a land card, once you have it on the playing field, “tap” it from its upright position and turn it horizontal. A creature card that cost 1 swamp land means you have to tap 1 swamp land to play that creature. Once a land card is used in that turn it stays tapped until your next turn, in which you will untap all of your land cards.</p>
